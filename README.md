# Diophantine linear equation solver

## What is this project about?
This program can solve [Diophantine linear equations](https://brilliant.org/wiki/linear-diophantine-equations-one-equation/).
$$\alpha_1 \cdot x_1 + \alpha_2 \cdot x_2 + \alpha_3 \cdot x_3 + ... + \alpha_n \cdot x_n = c$$
It also prints the linear combination of gcd of the coefficients you entered.

## Basic usage
Run ```main.py```. You'll need to enter coefficients you want to use divided by spaces.
Then you'll need to enter what the equation will be equal to. And finally confirm you equation.
In the next line type `Y` if you want zero therms(with zero coefficients) to be shown and `n` if you don't.

The program will print gcd of the coefficients you entered, the linear combination of them. 
Finally, all solution of the equation will be shown.
